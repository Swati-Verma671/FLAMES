# FLAMES
Many people grew up with this game so I thought I would make a project on this to revisit my memories. For those who don't know how this game is played-

## Rules
- Write the names of you and your crush (or your lover or whoever it can be)
- Cross out all the letters that are present in both the names.(For Ex:- If the name chosen is Maria and Jane, then we strike out all the A's in both the names.)
- After striking out the letters, count the no. of letters left.
- With the numbers remaining, count through the letters of FLAMES.
- Wherever the last count lasts will be the future fate of you and your partener.
- The full form of FLAMES is F for Friendship, L for Lovers, A for Affection, M for Marriage, E for Enemies and S for "you-know-what" ;D
